title: About
---

I am a senior at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) working towards my bachelor's degree in mathematics and computer science. I have a penchant for learning and a growing passion for 
helping others find the beauty in these subjects. In my free time, I enjoy composing, reading, Jiu Jitsu, and spending time with friends.

## What I'm up to
I currently live in Troy, NY where I have been tutoring through the school as well as privately. I spend most of my time working on my research. You can find some of my projects on my 
projects page.
